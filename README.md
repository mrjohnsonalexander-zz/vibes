This is the spec for my final.

A vibe is a feeling inpsired by a shared personal experience, our members post vibes offered to our community, and transparently share reviews of vibes experienced.
The canary launch of this platform is targeted for USA WA State adults over 18 years, and ~75% of the 7.5 million WA Residence are over 18.

Vibe is a online community platform for listing and reviewing shared experiences, promoting community health by enabling our members to:
1. Register to join the local community, login, and logout.
2. Build an online profile complete with media and basic details. 
3. Post vibe offerings to the community and enable community comments.
4. Search posted vibes, sorted by date, and filtered optionally by: costs, and by any matching title words.
5. Post frequency reviews of community vibes, and enable community comments.
6. Create/Send/Reply direct messages to community members.
7. Post/Put/Delete members on todo list 
8. On Profile list all: frequency reviews, todo profiles, and vibes/frequency's posted.
9. Premimum capabilities: Upto 5 vibes posted at a time, unlimited comments and messages, additional profile pictures.
10. Basic capabilities: Limited to 1 Vibe at a time, can initiate by sending 1 message per day, reply to any message, post upto 10 comments per month. 
11. Future development may include: Payments, Push notifications, Emails, Calander, Map, Facebook/Google Auth, Mobile App.
